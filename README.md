## All Data Structures and Algorithms I've learned so far
Compilation: `g++ [program file name] -o [output file name] --std=c++11`
OR `make [filename] && ./[filename]`
Execution: (On Windows) `.\[output file name]` (On Linux/Unix) `./[output file name]`
> Note: files with .pde extension can be executed in processing environment
